    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors of this paper \\[1\\] propose a method of utilizing the flexibility of a Bayesian Neural Network with Latent Variables to allow for the decomposition of Aleatoric and Epistemic Uncertainty. When performing supervised learning or reinforcement learning there are a number of ways to gain insight into the overall uncertainty, such as frequentist bootstrapping (running multiple trials) or implementing a Bayesian modeling approach to incorporate a distribution over models. Both these approaches however only provide the overall magnitude of the uncertainty and do not allow for further interrogation of where those uncertainties might be coming from. Without knowing how much of the variation is due to inherent randomness (aleatoric) or due to the lack of collected data in specific areas (epistemic) there is no way to know precisely how to improve the model. For instance would it be useful to collect more data in a certain area? Would it be useful to defer the prediction to an expert? In reinforcement learning this could be framed as, where does my agent need to explore more to maximize how much it learns about the environment? Being able to decompose uncertainty into these two core components, epistemic and aleatoric (whilst still using a complex and flexible model such as a neural network) enables practioners of data science and statistics to tackle these problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from this primary aim, of decomposing uncertainty, the authors are also interested in proving that the abililty to achieve this decomposition of uncertainty in this way is an inherent property of the Bayesian Neural Network with Latent Variables (BBN+LV) (originally presented in an early paper by the author \\[2\\]) and not an artefact of the sampling methodology. As such they attempt to show that the BNN+LV has the properties required to split epistemic from aleatoric uncertainty when using both BB-alpha (a similar method to BBVI although using an alpha divergence) and also Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC)."

    "To distinguish between the epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties, the authors required a method to decompose where the uncertainties are being introduced - either the uncertainties across the weights (epistemic) or the uncertainty inherent within the noise of the data (aleatoric). \n",
    "\n",
    "In the original Depeweg paper \\[1\\] the authors proposed two ways to perform this estimation, via entropy and via variance. In the results section of the paper, the authors only present and discuss their results in terms of the entropy and so this is the method that we will focus on reproducing. The entropy of a set of points represent how much inherent variation exists. Formally this can be calculated using the functional pdf, but in this case where our BNN+LV posterior is not a known form, it must be approximated using a technique such as K-Nearest Neighbor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using KNN as an approximate Entropy calculation goes back to a 1987 paper by Kozachenko & Leonenko \\[7\\]\n",
    "although is more succinctly stated in a later 2003 paper by Singh et al \\[8\\] with the relevant equation being listed as (Eqn. 4). Entropy as a concept is actually a measurement of randomness and is leverged in many fields from thermodynamics to algorithms which optimize splits in a decision tree. In this specific case, the randomness (entropy) that is interesting is how much difference there is in the predictions at each input data point. K-Nearest Neighbors is therefore an obvious candidate for an approximation as it enables an efficient and fast method to calculate distances between a vector of datapoint (a set of $y*$ predictions for a given $x*$). \n",

    "This KNN approximation of the Entropy, in general form, is stated as:\n",

    "So in essence the entropy is the average of the natural log of the distance from each point to its closest neighbour, scaled by the size and dimensionality of the problem at hand. The additional constants are related to the surface area of a hypersphere in $p$ dimensions and scales the entropy based on the overall size of the hypersphere within which the entropy is being calculated. \n",
    "\n",
    "Singh et al [\\8\\] also propose more robust methods of approximation utilizing more than just the single nearest neighbouring point but for simplicity of reproduction and to more closely match the Depeweg paper \\[1\\], which cites the original Kozachenko paper \\[8\\], we will stick to the single nearest neighbor method."

Naively applying the entropy calculation across the outputs of the BNN+LV however will not give us anything more than the overall uncertainty, including both aleatoric and epistemic. To decompose this we need to calculate two entropies, the overall entropy and the entropy which occurs having marginalized out the uncertainty over the weights (aleatoric uncertainty).

    "2. Make multiple predictions using a single set of model weights, $W_i$ and calculate the entropy at each $y*$ within this model. Repeat this process for every different model individually ($W_i,...,W_M$) and average the entropy across these outcomes. By separately calculating the average of the entropy across many different models through repeated sampling of the weights, this averages out the effects of the uncertainty between models (aka marginalizes out the epistemic uncertainties leaving just the aleatoric).\n",
